Whispers is a **static structured text** analysis tool designed for parsing various common software config formats in search of hardcoded secrets. Whispers can be used as a CLI executable, as well as a Python library, which is meant to facilitate its integration into automated processes and pipelines.

* :clipboard: [Release notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)
* :lady_beetle: [Report a bug](issues/new) 


## Installation

```
pip3 install whispers
```


## Supported formats

* :clipboard: Complete coverage for JSON, YAML, XML, and [many other formats](tests/fixtures).
* :hammer_and_wrench: [Contribute](issues/new) by submitting format samples!


## Detects

* Passwords
* API tokens
* Cloud keys
* Private keys
* Hashed credentials
* Authentication tokens
* Webhooks
* Sensitive files
* Dangerous functions (Python)
* [See all rules](whispers/rules)


## Usage

### CLI

```
whispers
whispers target/file/or/dir

whispers --help
whispers --info
whispers --config config.yml target/file/or/dir
whispers --output /tmp/secrets.out target/file/or/dir
whispers --exitcode 7 target/file/or/dir

whispers --rules aws-id,aws-secret target/file/or/dir
whispers --xrules sensitive target/file/or/dir

whispers --groups apikeys,misc target/file/or/dir
whispers --xgroups files target/file/or/dir

whispers --severity BLOCKER,CRITICAL target/file/or/dir
whispers --xseverity MINOR target/file/or/dir
```

### Python

```py
import whispers

args = "-c whispers/config.yml -R sensitive -S INFO tests/fixtures"

for secret in whispers.secrets(args):
  print(f"[{secret.file}:{secret.line}] {secret.key} = {secret.value}")
```

## Config

There are several configuration options available in Whispers. Itâ€™s possible to include and exclude results based on file path, keys, values, individual or grouped rules, and severity levels. There is a [default configuration file](whispers/config.yml) that will be used if you don't specify a custom one.

Note: all keys and static values are always included, and then filtered out based on config and [rules](whispers/rules).

* File path specifications are lists of globs
* Key and value specifications are lists of regular expressions 
* Rule specifications are lists of rule IDs or inline rule definitions
* Everything else is a list of strings


### Simple examples

Exclude all log files:

```yaml
exclude:
  files:
    - .*\.log
```

Only scan for CRITICAL level findings in .npmrc files, excluding a known testing value:

```yaml
include:
  files:
    - "**/*.npmrc"
  severity:
    - CRITICAL

exclude:
  values: 
    - ^token_for_testing$
```

### General structure

```yaml
include:
  files:
    - "**/*.yml"  # glob
  rules:
    - password
    - privatekey
    - id: starks  # inline rule
      message: Whispers from the North
      severity: CRITICAL
      value:
        regex: (Aria|Ned) Stark
        ignorecase: True
  groups:
    - apikeys
  severity:
    - CRITICAL
    - BLOCKER
    - MAJOR

exclude:
  files:
    - .*/tests?/  # regex
  keys:
    - ^foo        # regex
  values:
    - bar$        # regex
  rules:
    - apikey-known


```

The fastest way to tweak detection in a repeatable way (ie: remove false positives and unwanted results) is to copy the default [config.yml](whispers/config.yml) into a new file, adapt it, and pass it as an argument to Whispers, for example: `whispers -c config.yml -r starks target`.

Simple filtering based on rules and severity can also be done with CLI arguments directly, without having to provide a config file. See `whispers --info` for details.


## Custom rules

Rules specify the actual things that should be pulled out from key-value pairs. There are several common ones that come built-in, such as AWS keys and passwords, but the tool is made to be easily expandable with new rules.

- Custom rules can be defined in the main config file under `rules:` key
- Custom rules can be added to [whispers/rules](whispers/rules/) directory

```yaml
- id: rule-id                 # unique rule name
  description: Values formatted like AWS Session Token
  message: AWS Session Token  # report will show this message
  severity: BLOCKER           # one of BLOCKER, CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, INFO

  key:                        # specify key format
    regex: (aws.?session.?token)?
    ignorecase: True          # case-insensitive matching

  value:                      # specify value format
    regex: ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])[A-Za-z0-9\+\/]{270,450}$
    ignorecase: False         # case-sensitive matching
    minlen: 270               # value is at least this long
    isBase64: True            # value is base64-encoded
    isAscii: False            # value is binary data when decoded
    isUri: False              # value is not formatted like a URI

  similar: 0.35               # maximum allowed Jaro-Winkler similarity
                              # between key and value (1.0 being exactly the same)
```


## Plugins

All parsing functionality is implemented via [plugins](whispers/plugins/). Each plugin implements a class with the `pairs()` method that runs through files and yields `KeyValuePair` objects to be checked with [rules](whispers/rules/).

```py
from pathlib import Path
from whispers.models.pair import KeyValuePair

class PluginName:
  def pairs(self, filepath: Path) -> Iterator[KeyValuePair]:
    yield KeyValuePair(
      "key",
      "value",
      keypath=["node", "path", "to", "key"],
      file=filepath.as_posix()
    )
```
